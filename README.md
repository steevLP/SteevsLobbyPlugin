# SteevsLobbyPlugin 
I am making this Plugin, to finaly solve a Problem i have with currently avaiable Plugins.
I am aiming on creating a Plugin that once its done implements all the Features current Lobby Systems have and even charge Money for.

# Maintenance
Due to the Fact, that i am developing this Plugin in my free time i wont keep the support for it forever..  
I also wont create anything like an Update Schedule Updates release when their done.

# Current Stand
I am working on getting the plugin stable neither proper permission handling nor actualerror handling have been done.  
You may look at this plugin like an ALPHA at least most of the plugin is still work in progress and will be done 

# Roadmap 
As of now i am not sure enough, to make an entire roadmap..
The only things i can say as of now, are i am working on features and some stabillity things
